## Background

"tvmedg" means time- varying mediation analysis using g-formula

```{r chunkName, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/amly.png")
```

## G-formula flow

### Step 1

Fit parametric models for each of

- Mediation: as a function of lag values of itself, treatment, time-varying covariates (and their lag values), time-fixed covariates, and time since start (need to be flexible, using splines)

- Time-varying covariates: as functions of treatment, mediator ( and it’s lag values), their lag values, time-fixed covariates, and time since start (need to be flexible, using splines)

- Outcome: as a function of treatment, mediator (and it’s lag values), time-varying covariates (and their lag values), time-fixed covariates, and time since start (need to be flexible, using splines)

### Step 2

Resample the values of all variables at baseline (time t = 0). This is to increase precision of follow-up predictions

### Step 3

Using baseline samples of step 2 to predict follow-up, which can be describe as following figure (this is example to estimate $Q (\overline{a},\overline{a}^{*})$

### Step 4

Estimated $Q (\overline{a},\overline{a}^{*})$, $Q (\overline{a},\overline{a})$, $Q (\overline{a}^{*},\overline{a}^{*})$ are used to calculate: total effect, direct effect, indirect effect, and proportional explained

## Application

```{r setup}
library(tvmedg)
```
